# Details:
Remote Command Injection vulnerability arises when user controllable data can be executed by the server.
RCE is a vast topic. RCE types I have learned so far:
    1. Command injection attacks: System commands can be injected
    2. Code injection: Differen language specific codes can be injected.
    3. Already vulnerable services which are used by the server.

# Testing Guide:
Automatic Testing:
    1. Burp suite scan and active scan
    2. Nmap version scan
    3. Nikto scan
    4. Nuclei scan

Manual Testing:
    1. Check if any vulnerable software is used by the server
    2. Identify the injection points.
    3. Identify entry points which might be exploitable
    4. Fuzz injection points to be sure about the vulnerability
        => general payloads: /home/nine/PayloadsAllTheThings/Command Injection/Intruder
        i.   What kind of operating system the backend is using?
        ii.  Which programming language is used by the server?
        iii. Craft payload list accordingly
    5. Carefully try to find severity of the vulnerability.
