# Details:
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application provides direct access to objects based
on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization and access
resources in the system directly, for example database records or files. IDOR vulnerabilities can be used to
Retrieve data:
    a. Personally Identifiable Information(PII).
    b. Phone number
    c. Address
    d. Reciept/Voucher

Create Modify or Delete data:
    a. Email
    b. Account details
    c. Cart informations
    d. Perform impactful actions with another users account.

# Testing Guide:
Create atleast two account before testing.
Account1 = Attacker(usually with lower or equal privilege).
Account2 = Victim

Automatic Testing:
    1. Burp suite Autorize extension.
        i.   Put attackers authorization related cookies and headers in autorize configuration
        ii.  Browse the application logged in with victim account.
        iii. Check request sent in autorize. Fix if these is any authorization related problems of attackers account

Manual Testing:
    1. Find entry points where object references may occur.
        i.   Numeric user id: 12345
        ii.  Cryptographic user id hashes: XHASDRUT6T341CDSAF, casd-dfasfdas-asdlar, (base64 encoded ids) etc.
        iii. Plain text id: email, username etc.
    2. Find another valid users credentials (cookies/authorization headers) and try to access the object.
        i.   For a list of valid users or many numeric values use burp intruder
        ii.  For a single user use burp repeater
