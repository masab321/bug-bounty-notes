# Details:
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker
to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. Two types of xml attacks I found:
    1. XML External Entity
    2. XML injection

# Testing Guide:
Automatic Testing:
    1. Burp active scan and scan.

Manual Testing:
    1. Identy xml entry points.
        1. Injections: Check if any user controllable fields which are used in backend to create xml node. (automatic testing).

        2. Check if you can upload xml files.
            i.   Plain XML files.
            ii.  Zip/rar or other compressed files which will be parsed by an XML processor in server.
            iii. Check any file uploads if they accept xml files.
            iv.  CHeck any input fields if it is parsed by an XML processor.
        3. Check the severity of the bug:
            => payloads: /home/nine/PayloadsAllTheThings/XXE Injection/Intruders/xml_attacks.txt
            i.   Resource Allocation: billion laughs 
            ii.  Read local files
            iii. SSRF
            iv.  Blind XXE
